### Key Features:

StockOverflow is a web-based stocks app that prioritizes meaningful data over raw numbers.

* Multiple stocks scaled individually on the same chart to allow for better comparisons.
* Ability to select preset time periods and zoom in on any period within the past 5 years.
* LIVE updates every minute!
* Data from IEX.
* Optional Massively Multiplayer Online game that allows users to invest in stocks using pretend money. Users are then ranked on a leaderboard based on the monetary value of the stocks they own, if liquidated immediately (using live price data).
